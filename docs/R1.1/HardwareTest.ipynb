    "# Test incident reports\n",
    "#### [TIR1](#TIR1)\n",
    "* When VMOTOR turns on, there's parasitic power that feeds back to the gate of Q305, turning VMOTOR off.\n",
    "* The main issue is that USB data lines are feeding into VUSB through D401.  Insert a schottky diode between VUSB and D401 to prevent this.\n",
    "* Remove R117 because it makes a path from +3V3 to R115, Q100 into VDBG.  Removing R117 still allows the MCU to be programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [TIR2](#TIR2)\n",
    "* A parasitic current flows from VBAT to body diode of Q300, to R304, R303 through D106, D107, D108 , R110, R111, R112 to 3V3.  The leakage of D106, D107 and D108 causes the leakage.  To make matters worse, these diodes are in parallel, so their leakage currents add up.\n",
    "* Because the BAV170 was not available, BAT54C diodes have been used.  BAT54C has a much higher leakage current.\n",
    "* D106, D107 and D108 can be replaced by BC856B (emitter to pin 1 of BAT54, collector to pin 2 of BAT54, base to pin 3 of BAT54).  The power supply current in sleep mode is 0.6µA.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [TIR3](#TIR3)\n",
    "* When the IO6 pin of the MCU is HiZ, it's not low.  This causes the motor to turn during programming.\n",
    "* This voltage level on IO6 is odd, because the motor controller has internal pull down resistors.\n",
    "* The voltage on the input of the motor controller must be <0.5V to keep it off.\n",
    "* Adding a 10k pull down resistor, pulls the voltage on IO6 to 0.66V, which is turns the motor off in our case, but it's not a guarantee.\n",
    "* A 3k3 pull down resistor (a value already present in the design) pulls the voltage on IO6 to 0.235V, which is low enough to keep the motor off.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [TIR4](#TIR4)\n",
    "* The rectifier diode D301 has a voltage drop of 0.6V.  The resulting voltage is too low for the stepper motor driver to work.\n",
    "* A motor driver with a lower forward voltage is not really an option.  We would have to use a motor driver with external sensing circuitry.  Moreover, this would be a single-source component.\n",
    "* The solution is to use a schottky diode with a lower forward voltage.  This will come at the price of a higher leakage current.\n",
