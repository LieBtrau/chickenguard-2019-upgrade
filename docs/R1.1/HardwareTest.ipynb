    "# Test incident reports\n",
    "## [TIR1](#TIR1)\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "When VMOTOR turns on, there's parasitic power that feeds back to the gate of Q305, turning VMOTOR off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause\n",
    "The main issue is that USB data lines are feeding into VUSB through D401.  Insert a schottky diode between VUSB and D401 to prevent this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "Remove R117 because it makes a path from +3V3 to R115, Q100 into VDBG.  Removing R117 still allows the MCU to be programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [TIR2](#TIR2)\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Sleep current is too high\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause\n",
    "* A parasitic current flows from VBAT to body diode of Q300, to R304, R303 through D106, D107, D108 , R110, R111, R112 to 3V3.  The leakage of D106, D107 and D108 causes the leakage.  To make matters worse, these diodes are in parallel, so their leakage currents add up.\n",
    "* Because the BAV170 was not available, BAT54C diodes have been used.  BAT54C has a much higher leakage current.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "* D106, D107 and D108 can be replaced by BC856B (emitter to pin 1 of BAT54, collector to pin 2 of BAT54, base to pin 3 of BAT54).  The power supply current in sleep mode is 0.6µA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [TIR3](#TIR3)\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The motor turns during programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause\n",
    "* When the IO6 pin of the MCU is HiZ, it's not low.  \n",
    "* This voltage level on IO6 is odd, because the motor controller has internal pull down resistors.\n",
    "* The voltage on the input of the motor controller must be <0.5V to keep it off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "* Adding a 10k pull down resistor, pulls the voltage on IO6 to 0.66V, which is turns the motor off in our case, but it's not a guarantee.\n",
    "* A 3k3 pull down resistor (a value already present in the design) pulls the voltage on IO6 to 0.235V, which is low enough to keep the motor off.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [TIR4](#TIR4)\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The motor doesn't turn when powered by USB\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause\n",
    "* The rectifier diode D301 has a voltage drop of 0.6V.  The resulting voltage is too low for the stepper motor driver to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "* A motor driver with a lower forward voltage is not really an option.  We would have to use a motor driver with external sensing circuitry.  Moreover, this would be a single-source component.\n",
    "* The solution is to use a schottky diode with a lower forward voltage.  In this case, there is no need to select a low-leakage diode.  When the system is sleeping, VMOTOR will be low and there will be no leakage current through the diode when VUSB and VDBG are not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [TIR5](#TIR5)\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The voltage on the I2C bus is too high.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause\n",
    "There's an error in the I2C bus going to the LCD.  The gates of the NMOS are pulled up to 5V.  The NMOS transistors have a low Vg threshold.  The source can never rise high enough to turn the NMOS off.  So the NMOS is always conducting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "* The NMOS gates should be connected to 3V3 instead of 5V.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [TIR6](#TIR6)\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The device can no longer be powered by VBAT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause\n",
    "* The channel resistance of Q303 in the off-state reduced to 1.4kOhm, Preventing MOTOR_GATE from going low enough to turn Q300 and Q301 on.  The cause is uncertain, but it might have been current surges when discharging gates of Q300 and Q301.  \n",
    "* Later on, it has been found that a non-earthed soldering iron had been used.  The tip of the iron is at >100VAC, while the PCB being soldered is connected to earth by the oscilloscope probes.\n",
    "The gate of the SI3401A has no zener protection, so it's likely that the gate oxide has been damaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "* Replacing this part of the circuitry and using a PNP-transistor (BC856B) instead of a PMOS (AO3401A) should solve the problem.\n",
    "* Power the Pinecil soldering iron by an earthed power supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [TIR7](#TIR7)\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Voltage drops on VMOTOR when powered by USB\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause\n",
    "The voltage drop on USB causes the input voltage to drop below the minimum voltage of the motor driver.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "* Adding extra capacitance to the USB power supply is not feasible because according to simulations, it would require > 10000µF to get rid of the drop (5ohm power supply, 1ohm internal resistance, 200mA current peak during 2ms).\n",
    "* Add a schottky diode between VMOTOR and the capacitors feeding the motor driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [TIR8](#TIR8)\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Voltage switchover from USB to battery is not working.  There's a voltage drop on VMOTOR, causing the device to reset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause\n",
    "* The USB voltage drops rapidly down to 2.27V. The voltage on the gate of Q305 follows that voltage drop well.  It's one diode drop below VUSB.\n",
    "* When VUSB drops below 2.27V, the load switches off and VUSB drops much more slowly.  It takes 29ms for the gate of Q305 to drop below 0.78V, at which point Q305 turns off.\n",
    "* The problem is that Q305 switches off too late.  It should switch off well before VUSB drops below 2.27V.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "* Change C408 from 10µF to 100nF so that VUSB drops faster.\n",
    "* Add 10µF to C303 so that VMOTOR drops slower.\n",
    "* Add 100µF elco on VMOTOR\n",
    "* Add a 3.3K resistor between cathode of D302 and gate of Q305\n",
    "* Replace R305 by 1K\n",
