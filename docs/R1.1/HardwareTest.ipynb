    "# Test incident reports\n",
    "#### [TIR1](#TIR1)\n",
    "* When VMOTOR turns on, there's parasitic power that feeds back to the gate of Q305, turning VMOTOR off.\n",
    "* The main issue is that USB data lines are feeding into VUSB through D401.  Insert a schottky diode between VUSB and D401 to prevent this.\n",
    "* Remove R117 because it makes a path from +3V3 to R115, Q100 into VDBG.  Removing R117 still allows the MCU to be programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [TIR2](#TIR2)\n",
    "* A parasitic current flows from VBAT to body diode of Q300, to R304, R303 through D106, D107, D108 , R110, R111, R112 to 3V3.  The leakage of D106, D107 and D108 causes the leakage.  To make matters worse, these diodes are in parallel, so their leakage currents add up.\n",
    "* Because the BAV170 was not available, BAT54C diodes have been used.  BAT54C has a much higher leakage current.\n",
    "* Instead of the obscure BAV170, we might try using BC856B PNP-transistors instead.\n",

    "## Power enable by press of a momentary switch\n",
    "* **Test:** Power on by switch\n",

    "### Reverse polarity\n",
    "* **Test:** Connect 6V lab power supply with reverse polarity\n",

    "* **Actual result:** \n",
    "  * Vmotor remains at 1.2mV\n",
    "  * When applying correct polarity, Vmotor is 5.99V and the MCU works again.\n",

    "### Voltage drop over Q300 and Q301\n",
    "* **Test:** \n",
    "  * Connect a 6V lab power supply to the battery terminals.\n",
    "  * Disable 5V by pulling U301.4 low.\n",
    "  * Apply a 500mA constant current load to VMOTOR.\n",
    "  * Measure the voltage at the battery terminals and at the VMOTOR net.\n",
    "* **Expected result:** The voltage at the battery terminals xxx mV higher than at the VMOTOR net.\n",
    "  * rdsON is 45mohm for Vgs = 4.5V -> Voltage drop over Q300 and Q301 is 22.5mV at 500mA. -> 45mV total.\n",
    "* **Actual result:** \n",
    "  * VBAT = 5.95V\n",
    "  * VMOTOR = 5.89V\n",
    "  * VBAT - VMOTOR = 60mV\n",
    "  * Vgs(Q300) = 5.89 - 0.69 = 5.2V\n",
    "* **Status:** 45mV is close enough to 60mV ✅\n",

    "* **Status:** ✅\n",
    "  * D300 has a 500mV voltage drop, which is significant when compared to a common schottky diode.  We trade off forward voltage with reverse leakage.\n",
